class RigidBody:
    """ A material body in which the distances between any two points is invariable.
    If A, B, C, are three points os a RigidBody, the three distances AB, AC, BC remain
    constant, no matter how the RigidBody is moved.
    If three non-collinear points A, B, C on a rigid body are known, any other point D
    may be identified by specifying the three distancs DA, DB, DC.
    Even if the point D lies outside the apparent boundaries of the RigidBody, it may
    still be considered as a point of the body as long as the three distances DA, DB, DC
    are invariable: when the RigidBody moves from position 1 to position 2, point D moves
    with it
