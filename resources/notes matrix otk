Matrix

The Numeric module is for mathematics with two-dimensional matrices.
It provides some of the basic operations of linear algebra.
Matrices are restricted to only contain numbers.
This module is not a part of standard Python, rather it is a smaller module than the
common NumPy module.
To use these operations, first import the module with import numeric.

Returns a 2-dimensional matrix object corresponding to the given data, which must be a sequence of sequences.
