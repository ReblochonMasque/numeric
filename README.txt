Work In Progress - Do not use as is.


This package provides a pure python, simple, clear, readable, and tested
implementation of point, vector and matrix operations commonly used in
geometry.

If you need speed, you should use numpy or scipy.
If you need millions of points, and objects, this is probably not suitable.

Emphasis is put on the clarity of the implementation, lightness, and
ease of use.
